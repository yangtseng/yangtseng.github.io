    Supported by the NTU International Cooperation Add-on Project (Grant: 112L8503), I joined Dr. Okada's lab in Japan as visiting scholar to study mathematical modeling of cell signaling systems. There, I developed a mathematical model of cellular senescence and successfully simulated nuclear NFκB levels under various conditions.
