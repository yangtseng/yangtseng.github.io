    Supported by the NTU International Cooperation Add-on Project (Grant: 112L8503), I joined Dr. Okada's lab in Japan as visiting scholar to study mathematical modeling of cell signaling systems. There, I developed a mathematical model of cellular senescence and successfully simulated nuclear NFÎºB levels under various conditions.

## About Me

I am a Bioengineering PhD student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, fortunate to be co-advised by Prof. Fan Lam and Prof. Jonathan V. Sweedler. My research centers on developing novel tools by integrating machine learning, multi-omics, and biomedical imaging.
