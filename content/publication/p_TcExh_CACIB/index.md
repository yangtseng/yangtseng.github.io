abstract: Tumor-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes are crucial for anti-cancer immunity but can lose cytotoxic function in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), like anti-PD-1 therapy, enhance and prolong anti-tumor T cell responses. Despite its widespread clinical use, resistance to ICI develops in some patients, characterized by the formation of exhausted T cell (Tex). Here, we establish two single-cell murine models to explore regulatory network in Tex with ICI resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our study uncovers distinct T cell compositions, including both early and terminal Tex subsets, following prolonged ICI treatment, and reveal the differentiation trajectory of Tex subsets. Notably, we identify transcription factor Runx2 and its downstream targets as contributors to T cell exhaustion in both models. Moreover, our findings are validated across three distinct datasets, including a spatial transcriptomics dataset of 8 HCC patients undergoing ICI therapy, affirming the relationship between Runx2 and T cell exhaustion and highlighting the potential clinical significance of targeting Runx2 transcriptional regulation to enhance treatment responses in HCC patients receiving immunotherapy. Additionally, experimental validation used CADD522, a RUNX2-DNA binding inhibitor, reveals that treatment with the Runx2 inhibitor significantly augments the cytotoxic capacity, suppresses cancer growth and reduces T cell exhaustion compares to the vehicle. In summary, these findings elucidate Runx2 in regulating T cell exhaustion in response to prolonged ICI treatment, thereby influencing ICI efficiency, and suggest potential targets for combination therapy alongside ICI in HCC.
