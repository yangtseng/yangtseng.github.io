abstract = {Breast cancer stands as one of the most prevalent malignancies affecting women. Alterations in molecular pathways in cancer cells represent key regulatory disruptions that drive malignancy, influencing cancer cell survival, proliferation, and potentially modulating therapeutic responsiveness. Therefore, decoding the intricate molecular mechanisms and identifying novel therapeutic targets through systematic computational approaches are essential steps toward advancing effective breast cancer treatments. In this study, we developed an integrative computational framework that combines single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and multi-omics analyses to delineate the functional characteristics of malignant cell subsets in breast cancer patients. Our analyses revealed a significant correlation between cholesterol biosynthesis and HER2 expression in malignant breast cancer cells, supported by proteomics data, gene expression profiles, drug treatment scores, and cell-surface HER2 intensity measurements. Given previous evidence linking cholesterol biosynthesis to HER2 membrane dynamics, we proposed a combinatorial strategy targeting both pathways. Experimental validation through clonogenic and viability assays demonstrated that simultaneous inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis (via statins) and HER2 (via Neratinib) synergistically reduced malignant breast cancer cells, even in HER2-negative contexts. Through systematic analysis of scRNA-seq and multi-omics data, our study computationally identified and experimentally validated cholesterol biosynthesis and HER2 as novel combinatorial therapeutic targets in breast cancer. This data-driven approach highlights the potential of leveraging multiple molecular profiling techniques to uncover previously unexplored treatment strategies.}
