    text: "My computational biology research has spanned innovative projects in cancer research at National Taiwan University, including discovering treatment strategies, revealing transcriptional dynamics in T cell exhaustion, and developing a single-cell module detection method that identifies key genes in cancer progression.\n\nI have also learned mathematical modeling of cell signaling systems at Osaka University.\n\nI aim to develop machine learning methods that unravel cell fate mechanisms, transforming scientific insights into personalized therapeutic strategies."
